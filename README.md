## What is a Validating admission policy (VAP)?
Starting with version `1.26`, Kubernetes provides a new resource kind named `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`, which offers a declarative, in-process alternative to validating admission webhooks.  
Read more about it [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/).

## What is the Common expression language (CEL)?
CEL is an an open-source language created by Google that implements common semantics for expression evaluation.
In the world of Kubernetes, CEL is used within the ValidationAdmissionPolicy resource to declare validation rules and enforce them on a cluster.

## Local testing/playground
### Prerequisites
#### Minikube
Install the latest version using `brew`:
```
brew install minikube
```
If Minikube is already installed, upgrade it to the latest version:
```
brew upgrade minikube
```
If you're not using `brew`, see the [Minikube docs](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for other ways to install/upgrade.

> :warning: **Kubernetes version support**: To ensure that your Minikube supports the required Kubernetes version (1.27.0-rc.0), run the command `minikube config defaults kubernetes-version` and look for it in the output

### Instructions
#### 1. Start up your VAP-supported cluster
Run the following command:
```
minikube start --kubernetes-version=1.27.0-rc.0 --extra-config=apiserver.runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1  --feature-gates='ValidatingAdmissionPolicy=true'
```
This command specifies and enables the necessary Kubernetes version and feature gate to use VAPs in your cluster 🥳

#### 2. Download example files:
To see some policy enforcement in action, there are 3 components we will need:
  * `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` resource - this is where our rule logic will be defined.
  * `ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding` resource - a mandatory resource that specifies where and against which resources to run the validation. 
  * A resource manifest - an example YAML that violates our rule.

We have created these components for you so you can quickly run it on your machine. Simply [download the latest release](https://github.com/datreeio/validating-admission-policy/releases/latest/download/exampleFiles.zip) from this repo.

<br/>

#### 3. Apply the resources and see the enforcement in action
In your terminal, `cd` to the dir containing the example files, then:
1. Apply the `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` containing the rule logic
```
kubectl apply -f ./vap.yaml
```
This rule validates that the resource has at least 2 replicas.

2. Apply the `ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding`
```
kubectl apply -f ./vapBinding.yaml
```
The binding specifies that all objects with the label `example: test` will be validated.

3. Apply the violating resource
```
kubectl apply -f ./exampleResource.yaml
```
This Deployment has only 1 replica, and since it has the `example: test` label, it will be validated and denied by the VAP.
